## Nash Equilibrium in Mixed Strategy
* Mixed Strategy means you no longer have a dominating choice no matter which choice the other play will choose. So you need to use probability distribution of you actions.
* "The trick to finding the Nash Equilibrium in mixed strategy is that players must choose their probability distribution over their actions such that the other player is indifferent between his/her available actions. The result of this is that the other player will not have any incentive to deviate if he/she is indifferent between his/her actions."

  * You know what, at the very beginning, I calculated my strategy wrong and got higher probability for giving up, later it turned out to be 50:50. Not sure why, felt better for math doesn't tell me to give up, felt better for math also indicates the real world dilemma. Maybe I should study some psychology.
