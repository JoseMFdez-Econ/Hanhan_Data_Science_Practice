# Bayesian Approaches to Hypothesis Tests

## Approach 1 - The estimation (Single Prior) Approach
* <b>A parameter value</b> is NOT credible if it lies outside of the 95% HDI of the posterior distribution of that parameter. Otherwise when it's within the 95% HDI, it's among the credible values.
  * It address the credibility by considering the posterior estimate of the parameter, derived from a single prior distribution.
* Examples
  * Whether a parameter value is credible
  * Whether a difference of parameters is credible
* Differences of correlated parameters
  * <b>The marginal distributions of single parameters do not indicate the relationship between them.</b>
  * The conjoint
