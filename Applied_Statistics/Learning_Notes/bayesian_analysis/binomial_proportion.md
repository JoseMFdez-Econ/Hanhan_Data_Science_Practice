# Binomial Proportion via Mathematical Analysis

## The Likelihood Function: Bernoulli Distribution
* `p(y|θ) = power(θ, y) * power(1-θ, 1-y)`
  * This is the likelihood function of θ.
  * y has 2 nominal values (categorical without order), such as 0, 1.
  * If θ is the probability of y=1, then 1-θ is the probability of 1-y.
* Bernoulli distribution is a DISCRETE distribution over 2 values of y. The likelihood function specifies the probability at each value of θ but it's not a probability distribution.
