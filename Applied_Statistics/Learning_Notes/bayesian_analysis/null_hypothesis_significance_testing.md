# Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST)

* In NHST, the goal of <b>inference</b> is to ecide whether a particular value of a model parameter can be rejected.
* A good experiment is founded on the principle that the data is insulated from the experimenter's intentions.

## About p-value
* We want to know the probability of getting the actual outcome or an outcome more extreme relatice to what we expect. This is total probability is "p-value"
