# Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) vs Bayesian Analysis

* In NHST, the goal of <b>inference</b> is to ecide whether a particular value of a model parameter can be rejected.
* A good experiment is founded on the principle that the data is insulated from the experimenter's intentions.

## About p-value
* We want to know the probability of getting the actual outcome or an outcome more extreme relatice to what we expect. This is total probability is "p-value".
  * When p-value is less than a critical amount, we reject the null hypothesis.
  * However, when we are rejecting the null hypothesis, we still have no particular degree of disbelief in it, we don't have any particular disbelief in any other hypothesis neither. <b>All what we know is, the actual observation lies in an extreme end of the space of possibility</b>, if the intended experiment were repeated.
  
## NHST vs Bayesian Analysis
* NHST analysis depends on the intertions of the experimenter, and these intentions define the space of all possible (unobserved) data.
  * However the dependence on experimenter's intertions is conflicting with the opposite assumption that the experimenter's intentions have no effect on the observed data.
* Bayesian analysis does not depend on the space of possible unobserved data, it only operates on the actual observed data.
