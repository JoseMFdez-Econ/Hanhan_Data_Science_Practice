# Point Estimation

## Maximum Likelihood Estimation
ðŸŒº The purpose is to find the most likely estimated PDF parameter `Î¸`, this estimated value is `Î¸_hat`.

* Likelihood function `L(Î¸) = f(x1, Î¸)*f(x2, Î¸)*f(x3, Î¸)*....*f(xn, Î¸)`
  * `f(xi, Î¸)` is the PDF (probability distribution function) of the observation xi
* To get maximum likelihood estimator for `Î¸`:
  * Step 1 - Take natural log of L(Î¸), ln(L(Î¸)).
    * Because natural log is strictly increasing, it's easier to find the estimated parameter `Î¸_hat` that can maximize ln(L(Î¸)), the results will be the same as maximize L(Î¸).
  * Step 2 - Take derivate of ln(L(Î¸))
    * `ln'(L(Î¸)) = 0`, calculated value is `Î¸_hat`, the estimated `Î¸`.
* We repeat the experiment n times, observing sample X1, X2, ... Xn. `u(X1, X2, ... Xn)`is the function used to estimate `Î¸`. When `Î¸_hat`=`Î¸`, we say `u(X1, X2, ... Xn) is the unbiased estimator, otherwise it's biased.
