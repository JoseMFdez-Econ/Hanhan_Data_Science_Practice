# Projects Location
There are many implemented projects stored in different folders, I need to record their locations when I am looking for them.

* Lime, Visualization, Visualizaed Feature Importance
  * https://github.com/hanhanwu/Hanhan_Data_Science_Practice/blob/master/Better4Industry/lime_interpretable_ML.ipynb
* Lime, Visualization, MultiClass
  * https://marcotcr.github.io/lime/tutorials/Tutorial%20-%20continuous%20and%20categorical%20features.html
  * All the features have to be int or float, but you can indicate categorical features
* SHAP, Feature Importance, Visualization
  * https://github.com/hanhanwu/Hanhan_Data_Science_Practice/blob/master/Better4Industry/Feature_Selection_Collection/try_shap_xgboost.ipynb
  * It also supports multiclass now:
    * How to generate multi-class output: https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/367
    * https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/367
    
* Multi-Class, Confusion Matrix
  * https://github.com/hanhanwu/Hanhan_Break_the_Limits/blob/master/attack_signals_recommendation_system/generate_rules.ipynb
  
* Simplified User Trained Search Engine - NN, Neural Network, Interactive
  * https://github.com/hanhanwu/Hanhan_NLP/blob/master/short_context_search.py
  
* p-value, t-test to compare 2 lists of values
  * https://github.com/hanhanwu/Hanhan_Applied_DataScience/blob/master/Simple%20Production%20Solutions.ipynb
  
* Find Optimal Thresholds of the Model Prediction
  * https://github.com/hanhanwu/Hanhan_Applied_DataScience
  * You can use whatever metrics you want to use, but by changing thresholds, it will show you which threshold will get the optimal metrics value
  
* geckodriver errors
  * On Windows: https://github.com/hanhanwu/Hanhan_Break_the_Limits/blob/master/Ideas_Spark/track_siliconvalley_vancouver_trend.ipynb
